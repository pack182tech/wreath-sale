# PRD.md

This a product requirements document for a website. The site is a one-off sale for purchasing wreaths from a local boy scout troop. It manages end-to-end sale, attribution to the scout, tracking of sales when ordered from outside the site, tracking of inventory, emailing customers details, emailing customers for pick-up, and tracking the performance of each scout's sales. Each scout should have a unique link, and a QR code emailed to the parent.

Backend should be google sheets for free (boy scout account exists). Deployment through github.io for free (boy scout account exists). An administrative dashboard should allow changes to ALL verbiage on the site. A "leaderboard" page should gamify scouts sales.
